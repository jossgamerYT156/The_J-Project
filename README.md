# The J Project!

The J-Project is the product of lots of free-time, boredom, and a spice of depression / ADHD_Hyperfocusing!
Nothing but MADNESS and lots of fun! `:)`

it all repeating the same words ****Create, Have fun, Learn New Things Everyday!****

The J-Project(might as well just say is a branding for "Just A something") is conformed out of three main projects!...

...

and maybe some background ones too

The three main ones are  [J-OS](#j-os) , [J-Lang](#j-lang) and the [VSC Extension](J-Lang_VSC_Extension).

**Why doing The J-Project in the first place?**
because...
because.... well...
...

Why not?
boredom, coffee and lots of dreams are the funding of future, and luckily for LillyDev, she has most of them all!
...
excepting the coffee... then she wouldn't be able to work...

and because programming is a great way to spend time while trying to deal with insomnia!

# J-Lang

J-Lang - the brainchild of boredom, hyperfocus, and an ADHD brain on overdrive.

**What's J-Lang?**

J-Lang is a programming language born out of sheer randomness and a lack of better things to do. It's the result of a chaotic blend of coding, procrastination, and a sprinkle of "what if?"
Why J-Lang?

Why not? J-Lang exists for no reason other than to indulge in the absurdity of coding without a purpose. It's the manifestation of a mind that can't sit still, always seeking new challenges and distractions.
**Features**

  - Syntax that makes even seasoned developers scratch their heads.
  - Functions created on a whim, with no rhyme and for reason.
  - A documentation that's as chaotic as the language itself.

**What to Expect**

Expect the unexpected. J-Lang is a rollercoaster ride of confusion, frustration, and occasional moments of clarity. Embrace the chaos, and you might just find yourself having fun.


# J-Lang VSC Extension

Extend the madness with the J-Lang Visual Studio Code Extension.
What's the Extension About?

Tired of guessing whether your J-Lang syntax is correct? Say no more! The J-Lang VSC Extension is here to save the day. Now you can code in peace, knowing that your syntax errors will be pointed out in real-time(or sort of).
**Features**

  - Syntax highlighting that's as quirky as J-Lang itself.
  - A bit of error detection to save you from the SYNTAX_ERR nightmare... and save a bit of your Sanity.
  - Seamless(sort of) integration with Visual Studio Code for a smoother(depending on the version) coding experience.

How to Use

  - Install the extension from the Visual Studio Code Marketplace.
  - Start coding in J-Lang with confidence.
  - Let the extension handle the syntax checking for you.

Disclaimer

Warning: Using this extension may cause an increase in productivity and a decrease in sanity.

# J-OS

Prepare yourself for the madness of J-OS - the Operative System that defies logic or any bit of human reason.
The heck is J-OS?!

J-OS is the result of a wild experiment gone wrong. It's an Operative System like no other, born out of a desire to code without boundaries and a complete lack of knowledge about assembly and the lack of sanity of one human being.

Based from:
 - nothing
J-OS is the result of... well... lots of free time, stress and a spice of MADNESS `:)`

**Features (or Lack Thereof)**

  - A GUI? Forget about it. J-OS operates in a world of pure command lines.
  - Updates? Who knows when they'll come or what they'll bring.
  - Based on nothing but sheer willpower and a stubborn refusal to conform to conventional OS standards.

Current Status

J-OS is in a perpetual state of pre-alpha, with no end in sight. But hey, who needs stability when you have chaos?

**Disclaimer**

Proceed with caution. Using J-OS may result in confusion, frustration, and existential questioning.

# In Conclusion

J-Project is the borning out of lots of Tea, Sugar, Hyperfocusing and TONS of nonsense dreamed by LillyDev.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A quick Disclaimer(yes, another one.)
J-Project doesn't has an specific reason... it just... exists.
and LillyDev is very bad at coding, so you might will see lots of copy-pasted code or VERY bad syntax in anything else that isn't J-Lang(even on that)

ATTE: LillyDev
  A.K.A: The Worst Programmer In The World.
